    "Overfitting:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model becomes too complex and learns to fit the training data too closely.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key consequences of overfitting include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a : Poor generalization: The model fails to generalize well beyond the training data, leading to inaccurate\n",

    "b : High variance: The model's predictions are highly sensitive to small changes in the training data,\n",

    "3 : Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, regularization strength,\n",
    "    or the number of layers, can help find a better balance between simplicity and complexity.\n",
    "4 : Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models (e.g., using bagging or boosting techniques) can improve performance by\n",

    "\n",
    "L1 regularization, also known as Lasso Regression, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients to the loss function. It encourages the model to reduce the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",

    "Dropout:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a technique commonly used in neural networks. It randomly sets a fraction of the output units (neurons) to zero during each training iteration. By doing so, it forces the network to learn redundant representations, making it more robust and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training.

This prevents the model from continuing to optimize and overfitting the training data excessively.\n",
    "Data Augmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying random transformations to the existing data. These transformations can include rotations, translations, scaling, flipping, and more. Data augmentation increases the size of the training set and introduces variations, helping the model generalize better.\n",
    "Batch Normalization:\n",

    "Batch normalization is a technique used in neural networks to normalize the inputs of each layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. It helps stabilize the learning process by reducing the internal covariate shift, allowing the network to learn more quickly and generalize better.\n",
    "These regularization techniques are not mutually exclusive, and they can be combined to achieve even better results. The choice of regularization technique depends on the problem domain, the complexity of the model, and the available data.
